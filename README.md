# Whimsical Weather
The team created a deployable calendar application called Whimsical Weather for Project 1 at the UNCC Coding Bootcamp.

## Description
The Whimsical Weather app is a calendar application that takes an input of a zip code within the United States and displays the weather for the next two weeks in that area. The data shown on the calendar is temperature and sky information. The app also deploys a GIF and fun-fact.

## Functionality
The UI used for the calendar is Toast UI, and the html formatting tool used is Bulma. The zip code is taken in with an on-click button that ties in three API's: weather, GIF, and fun-fact. The weather, and GIF after a word related to the temperature is randomly selected from an array, is displayed on the calendar. There is a button on each day of the week that can be clicked to display a fun fact in a modal. Each time a new zip code is entered the previous information is cleared and the new information for that zip code is displayed.
